This retro game is built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

In 1981, a video game developer for Konami named Akira Hashimoto got the concept for Frogger when he was in his car and waiting for the traffic light to turn green. During his wait, he saw a frog trying to cross to the other side of the road. The frog was having difficulty crossing the road because of the vehicles that were passing through. Hashimoto then stopped his car on the side of the road and carried the frog to reach the other side. After helping the frog, the idea for Frogger immediately came to Hashimotoâ€™s mind.

This is my first project in the bootcamp I am taking. I hope to build on the game adding levels and more obstacles as my skill set grows. I loved playing Frogger as a kid and hope you do too! The object of the game is to direct the frog across the river bank by crossing a busy road and navigating a river by jumping on logs and turtles.

Rules of Frogger
You will start on the side of the road.
You will use the arrow keys to move Frogger up, down, left right.
The goal is to first get Frogger across the street without getting hit by a car.
If Frogger gets hit by a car, the game will reset.
Once Frogger is safely across the road you will need to get Frogger across the river using the logs and turtles to float.
If Frogger falls off the log or turtle, the game will reset.
Once Frogger is safely across the river bank, Frogger will start over and speed of the obstacles will increase.
Credits
I used a lot of resources to get this game done, specifically Franks Laboratory and Code with Ania Kubow. I also used Canva and Open Game Art.
